<h1>Chicken Tacos</h1>
<img src="../images/tacos.jpg" alt="a finished batch of delicious macaroni and cheese" width="300"/>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">This is a fairly basic taco recipe I have slowly transformed over the years.  It is very editable and I doubt I make the same flavor twice.  The ingredients, specifically <em>spices</em>, are constantly changing.  You may also add different peppers or slice the onion to be cooked along with the chicken.</p>

    <p class="description">This can be made fairly quickly on a weeknight, or you can let the chicken marinate for a few hours so when it's time to cook, it'll be done in no time.  You may replace corn tortillas for flour if you wish and broiling the tortillas is not completely necessary.</p>

<h2>Cooking Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2-3 lbs Chicken <B></B>reast</li>
    <li>1-2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3-4 Tablespoons Cumin</li>
    <li>2 Tablespoons Smoked Paprika</li>
    <li>2 Teaspoons Cayenne Pepper</li>
    <li>2-3 Garlic Cloves</li>
    <li>3 Tablespoons Hot Sauce (Cholula preferable)</li>
    <li>1 Medium Jalapeno</li>
    <li>Corn Tortillas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extras/Toppings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Shredded Cheese (fresh shredded is always best)</li>
    <li>Sliced Avocado</li>
    <li>Shredded Lettuce</li>
    <li>Diced Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Diced Onions</li>
    <li>Sour Cream</li>
    <li>Limes</li>
    <li>Hot Sauce of Choice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol class="steps">
    <li>Remove the fat from the chicken breasts and cut them into bite-size pieces. Place into medium sized bowl.</li>
    <li>Wash and dry the jalapeno. Remove the seeds if you want less spice, and dice the pepper.</li>
    <li>Peel and finely dice the garlic</li>
    <li>Add jalapeno, garlic, the spices, and hot sauce to the bowl and thoroughly coat the chicken.</li>
    <li>Preheat large pain over medium-high heat with oil.</li>
    <li>Add chicken to pan, cook until done and remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Place oven on Broil, and cook the tortillas until soft, approximately 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Construct tacos to your liking with toppings.</li>
</ol>

<p class="description">I will gladly be constructively criticized for this recipe, as it's ever evolving.  I rarely include the same spices or toppings.</p>
